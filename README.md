I'm a senior at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology. I primarily work on [eAbsentee](https://github.com/eAbsentee/eAbsentee), a web app built to process absentee ballot requests in the state of Virginia.

If you'd like to reach out to me, you can find my email on my [personal website](https://raunak.io).
